## About the Game

**Tappy Fish** is one of my first game development projects, created to help me learn the basics of game mechanics and development. In this simple arcade game, players control a fish that must avoid obstacles and collect points. The gameplay is easy to understand, but it becomes increasingly challenging as you try to beat your high score.

## Key Features

- **Basic Controls:** Tap to make the fish jump and avoid obstacles.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** The game becomes harder the longer you play.
- **High Score Tracking:** Try to beat your own high score with each attempt.
